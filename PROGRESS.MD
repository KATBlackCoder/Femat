# FEMAT Website Development Progress

## Project Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the FEMAT (F√©d√©ration Malienne de Taekwondo) website project.

**Project Start Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Current Status**: Phase 5 In Progress üöß  
**Overall Progress**: 50% Complete (4 of 8 phases)

## Recent UI & Architecture Improvements
- Extracted Hero, Features, and CTA sections into their own components for better modularity and reuse.
- Created a Nuxt UI-based `NavigationMenu` component using `<UNavigationMenu>` for idiomatic navigation.
- Improved `AppHeader.vue` to use Nuxt UI components and patterns.
- Created a modern, user-friendly error page using Nuxt UI components (`UCard`, `UIcon`, `UButton`).
- Created content structure and initial markdown files for about, contact, news highlights, and quick links in the content/ directory as the first step of Phase 2.
- Added NewsHighlightsSection and QuickLinksSection components, and integrated them into the homepage to display content from markdown files as part of Phase 2.
- Created a modular `CarouselSection.vue` component in `components/layout/` for image galleries, supporting dynamic titles and image arrays via props.
- Utilized `<NuxtImg>` for responsive, optimized images in the carousel.
- Integrated two CarouselSection components side by side on the homepage, sourcing images from the assets directory using Nuxt Image.
- - The events page now features a calendar-centric UI for event browsing, improving discoverability and UX.
- **CarouselSection now supports per-image custom width/height, allowing flexible sizing for each image. Homepage carousels (presidents/partners) now use this for improved layout and visual consistency.**

## Recent Technical Fixes
- Renamed the `locales` directory to `i18n` for clarity and convention.
- Removed `langDir` from `nuxt.config.ts` to resolve i18n locale file resolution issues with @nuxtjs/i18n.
- **Added a new phase for internationalization (i18n) and localization after the community features phase. All i18n-related tasks are now consolidated in this phase. Roadmap, TODO, and changelog updated accordingly.**
- **Phase 2 static pages are now implemented as Vue/Nuxt components only (no Nuxt Content/Markdown). Nuxt Content and content modeling are now introduced in Phase 3. Roadmap, TODO, and changelog updated to reflect this change.**
- Navigation links are now DRY: both NavigationMenu and AppFooter use a single useNavLinks composable for their links.
- Content queries are now locale-aware, ensuring the correct language is displayed for news and events.
- Fixed a bug with i18n where email addresses with `@` symbols were causing parsing errors.
- **Updated all Nuxt Content data fetching to use the modern `queryCollection` API, replacing the deprecated `queryContent` and ensuring compatibility with the latest version.**
- **Unified image asset strategy by moving all images to the `/public` directory. This resolved `<NuxtImg>` pathing issues by removing the conflicting `image.dir` configuration from `nuxt.config.ts` and deprecating the `useAssetImages.ts` composable.**

## Recent Internationalization Progress
- Home page (Hero, Features, CTA) is now fully internationalized. All user-facing text in these sections uses translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated. This marks a major milestone in Phase 4 (i18n & Localization).
- Footer is now fully internationalized. All user-facing text and quick links use translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated. This marks another milestone in Phase 4 (i18n & Localization).
- Contact page is now fully internationalized: all user-facing text uses translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated.
- About page is now fully internationalized: all user-facing text uses translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated.
- Error page is now fully internationalized: all user-facing text uses translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated.
- News and Events sections (list and detail pages) are now fully internationalized.
- All remaining hardcoded strings have been replaced with translation keys.
- Locale-specific SEO has been implemented site-wide using `useSeoMeta`.

## üìã Phase 5: Media & Resources (IN PROGRESS)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

### Completed Tasks
- [x] **Content Modeling**: Defined `galleries` and `resources` collections in `content.config.ts` and created corresponding content directories with sample files.
- [x] **Gallery Feature**:
    - [x] **Architecture**: Decided to create a new, specialized `GalleryCarousel.vue` to handle rich gallery data (images with captions), keeping it separate from the simpler `CarouselSection.vue` used on the homepage. This avoids bloating the layout component and keeps concerns separate.
    - [x] **List Page**: Implemented `pages/gallery/index.vue` with a grid of `GalleryCard` components.
    - [x] **Detail Page**: Implemented `pages/gallery/[slug].vue` to display a single gallery using the new `GalleryCarousel.vue`.
    - [x] **Data Fetching**: All content queries use the modern, locale-aware `queryCollection` API.
    - [x] **Internationalization**: The entire gallery feature is fully internationalized.
- [x] **Image Asset Unification**:
    - [x] Fixed a critical bug preventing gallery images from loading by unifying the site's image asset strategy.
    - [x] All images are now located in the `/public` directory to ensure compatibility with `<NuxtImg>`.
    - [x] Removed the restrictive `image.dir` configuration from `nuxt.config.ts` and deleted the `useAssetImages.ts` composable.
    - [x] All media assets are now correctly optimized by `@nuxt/image`.

### Planned Tasks:
- [x] Implement the Resource Hub (`/resources`) with document listings.
