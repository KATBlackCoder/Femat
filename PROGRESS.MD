# FEMAT Website Development Progress

## Project Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the FEMAT (F√©d√©ration Malienne de Taekwondo) website project.

**Project Start Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Current Status**: Phase 5 In Progress üöß  
**Overall Progress**: 50% Complete (4 of 8 phases)

## Recent UI & Architecture Improvements
- Extracted Hero, Features, and CTA sections into their own components for better modularity and reuse.
- Created a Nuxt UI-based `NavigationMenu` component using `<UNavigationMenu>` for idiomatic navigation.
- Improved `AppHeader.vue` to use Nuxt UI components and patterns.
- Created a modern, user-friendly error page using Nuxt UI components (`UCard`, `UIcon`, `UButton`).
- Created content structure and initial markdown files for about, contact, news highlights, and quick links in the content/ directory as the first step of Phase 2.
- Added NewsHighlightsSection and QuickLinksSection components, and integrated them into the homepage to display content from markdown files as part of Phase 2.
- Created a modular `CarouselSection.vue` component in `components/layout/` for image galleries, supporting dynamic titles and image arrays via props.
- Utilized `<NuxtImg>` for responsive, optimized images in the carousel.
- Integrated two CarouselSection components side by side on the homepage, sourcing images from the assets directory using Nuxt Image.
- - The events page now features a calendar-centric UI for event browsing, improving discoverability and UX.
- **CarouselSection now supports per-image custom width/height, allowing flexible sizing for each image. Homepage carousels (presidents/partners) now use this for improved layout and visual consistency.**

## Recent Technical Fixes
- Renamed the `locales` directory to `i18n` for clarity and convention.
- Removed `langDir` from `nuxt.config.ts` to resolve i18n locale file resolution issues with @nuxtjs/i18n.
- **Added a new phase for internationalization (i18n) and localization after the community features phase. All i18n-related tasks are now consolidated in this phase. Roadmap, TODO, and changelog updated accordingly.**
- **Phase 2 static pages are now implemented as Vue/Nuxt components only (no Nuxt Content/Markdown). Nuxt Content and content modeling are now introduced in Phase 3. Roadmap, TODO, and changelog updated to reflect this change.**
- Navigation links are now DRY: both NavigationMenu and AppFooter use a single useNavLinks composable for their links.
- Content queries are now locale-aware, ensuring the correct language is displayed for news and events.
- Fixed a bug with i18n where email addresses with `@` symbols were causing parsing errors.

## Recent Internationalization Progress
- Home page (Hero, Features, CTA) is now fully internationalized. All user-facing text in these sections uses translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated. This marks a major milestone in Phase 4 (i18n & Localization).
- Footer is now fully internationalized. All user-facing text and quick links use translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated. This marks another milestone in Phase 4 (i18n & Localization).
- Contact page is now fully internationalized: all user-facing text uses translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated.
- About page is now fully internationalized: all user-facing text uses translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated.
- Error page is now fully internationalized: all user-facing text uses translation keys, and both English and French locales are populated.
- News and Events sections (list and detail pages) are now fully internationalized.
- All remaining hardcoded strings have been replaced with translation keys.
- Locale-specific SEO has been implemented site-wide using `useSeoMeta`.
