# FEMAT Website Development Progress

## Project Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the FEMAT (Fédération Malienne de Taekwondo) website project.

**Project Start Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Current Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅  
**Overall Progress**: 15% Complete (1 of 7 phases)

## Recent UI & Architecture Improvements
- Extracted Hero, Features, and CTA sections into their own components for better modularity and reuse.
- Created a Nuxt UI-based `NavigationMenu` component using `<UNavigationMenu>` for idiomatic navigation.
- Improved `AppHeader.vue` to use Nuxt UI components and patterns.
- Created a modern, user-friendly error page using Nuxt UI components (`UCard`, `UIcon`, `UButton`).

## Recent Technical Fixes
- Renamed the `locales` directory to `i18n` for clarity and convention.
- Removed `langDir` from `nuxt.config.ts` to resolve i18n locale file resolution issues with @nuxtjs/i18n.
