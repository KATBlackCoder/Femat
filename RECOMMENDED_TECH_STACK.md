# Recommended Tech Stack for the FEMAT Website

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the recommended technology stack for the development of the Fédération Malienne de Taekwondo (FEMAT) website. The selection is based on the principles of performance, developer experience, long-term maintainability, and scalability. This stack is designed to be modern, cohesive, and perfectly aligned with the project's goals.

## 2. Core Recommendations

The proposed stack is built entirely within the **Nuxt.js ecosystem**. This provides a significant advantage as all the chosen tools are designed to work together seamlessly, reducing configuration overhead and potential conflicts.

---

### **Core Framework: [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)**

*   **Recommendation:** Nuxt.js is the best choice for the foundational framework.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Performance & SEO:** Its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities are crucial for performance and search engine optimization, ensuring that news and events are easily discoverable on Google.
    *   **Structure:** It provides a clear and organized project structure out-of-the-box.
    *   **Ecosystem:** It has a rich ecosystem of modules (like the ones recommended below) that make adding complex features straightforward.

---

### **UI & Styling: [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/)**

*   **Recommendation:** Use Nuxt UI for the component library, which is built on top of **Tailwind CSS**.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Speed:** Provides a complete set of beautiful, pre-built components (buttons, forms, modals) that drastically accelerate development.
    *   **Customization:** It is built on Tailwind CSS, meaning we can easily customize the look and feel to match the FEMAT branding and the colors of the Malian flag.
    *   **Consistency:** Ensures a consistent and accessible user interface across the entire website. It is also free and open-source.

---

### **Content Management: [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/)**

*   **Recommendation:** Nuxt Content is the ideal solution for managing all dynamic content.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Simplicity:** It operates as a "git-based CMS," meaning news articles, event details, and club information can be written directly in Markdown files within the project. This eliminates the need for a complex external database or a separate CMS service.
    *   **Version Control:** All content is version-controlled with Git, just like the code, providing a full history of changes.
    *   **Power:** Allows for embedding Vue components directly within Markdown, offering incredible flexibility for content layout.

---

### **State Management: [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)**

*   **Recommendation:** Pinia should be used for any global state management needs.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Official Standard:** It is the official, recommended state management library for Vue and Nuxt.
    *   **Simplicity & Type-Safety:** It offers an intuitive and simple API that is fully type-safe, reducing potential bugs.
    *   **Scalability:** While our initial needs are simple, Pinia is powerful enough to handle more complex state as the site grows.

---

### **Internationalization: [@nuxtjs/i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/)**

*   **Recommendation:** Implementing multilingual support from day one using `@nuxtjs/i18n` is critical.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Global Reach:** As an international sports federation, providing content in both French and English is essential for reaching a wider audience.
    *   **Seamless Integration:** This module automates the most difficult parts of internationalization, including locale-based routing and SEO optimization.
    *   **Future-Proofing:** It makes adding more languages in the future a trivial task.

---

### **Image Optimization: [@nuxt/image](https://image.nuxt.com/)**

*   **Recommendation:** Use `@nuxt/image` for all image handling.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Crucial Performance:** For a media-rich site (galleries, athlete photos), optimizing images is the single most important factor for page load speed. This module handles it automatically.
    *   **Modern Formats:** It serves images in next-gen formats like WebP and AVIF, which offer superior compression and quality compared to traditional formats.
    *   **Responsive By Default:** It automatically creates multiple sizes of each image and serves the appropriate one for the user's device, saving bandwidth and improving the user experience on mobile.
    *   **Seamless Integration:** It is a drop-in solution that integrates perfectly with the rest of the Nuxt stack and the chosen deployment providers.

---

### **Deployment Platform: [NuxtHub](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**

*   **Recommendation:** Deploy the website on a modern, Jamstack-focused platform like NuxtHub or Vercel.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Zero-Configuration:** Both platforms are optimized for Nuxt.js and offer a "zero-configuration" continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline straight from GitHub.
    *   **Performance:** They deploy to a global edge network, ensuring the website is fast for visitors anywhere in the world.
    *   **Scalability:** These platforms handle server management, scaling, and security, allowing the development team to focus solely on building the website. NuxtHub has the added benefit of being built by the Nuxt team itself.

## 3. Conclusion

This tech stack represents the current best-in-class approach for building a Nuxt.js application. It is highly integrated, performant, and provides an excellent experience for both the developers building the site and the end-users interacting with it. By adopting this stack, the FEMAT website will be built on a solid, future-proof foundation.
